# DNS Cache Poisoning Detection Tool

A Python-based tool to detect DNS cache poisoning attacks by querying multiple DNS resolvers, verifying TTL consistency, analyzing IP subnet mismatches, and comparing results with a trusted domain list. Built as part of a cybersecurity project with future IoT integration.

---

## 🔐 Features

- Queries multiple DNS resolvers: **Google (8.8.8.8), Cloudflare (1.1.1.1), and Quad9 (9.9.9.9)**
- Detects suspicious mismatches using:
  - **Exact IP matching**
  - **Subnet range analysis** (counts mismatch pairs)
  - **TTL consistency checking**
- Compares against a trusted CSV (`top_1000_domains.csv`)
- Classifies each domain as:
  - ✅ Safe
  - ⚠️ Likely Safe
  - ❌ Potential Poisoning
  - 🚨 Malicious or Unsafe
- Generates digital signature and verifies it on verdict

## 🧠 Subnet and TTL Logic

- IPs are checked pairwise to see if they fall within the same `/16` subnet.
- A mismatch counter is compared to a threshold to reduce false positives.
- TTLs are compared across resolvers to detect anomalies in DNS caching behavior.
